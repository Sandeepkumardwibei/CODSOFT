CodSoft Java Projects
This repository contains the solutions to three Java tasks completed as part of the CodSoft Internship program. Each task focuses on different Java programming concepts and challenges, demonstrating core Java skills.

Projects
1. Number Game
A simple game where the program generates a random number, and the user has to guess it within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback (e.g., "too high," "too low") after each guess and ends when the correct number is guessed or attempts are exhausted.

Features:
Random number generation
User input handling
Feedback on user guesses
Loop control for multiple attempts
2. Student Grade Calculator
